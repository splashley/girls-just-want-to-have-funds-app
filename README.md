## React based application with Avatar API and styled-components
Friendly introduction to finance for girls between the age of 10-15

## What it does:
Introduce the concept of savings through finance goals and timeframe.

## How we built it:
1) Brainstorm & sketch app design with Canvas

3) Create landing pages, routes
4) Wire buttons to link all the routes with useHistory
5) Create re-usable components (buttons, header)
6) Mobile responsiveness

## Challenges we ran into:
Github merge conflict
Understanding and implementing an API in a short period of time
Mobile responsiveness

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
Participated in our first hackathon and support other women in our community
Making an app with an interesting design communicates and is fun for women and girls
Our ability to make something complex, IE money management, seem simple and fun

## What we learned
Communication is extremely important during group projects
We were able to remain organized and structured through Zoom calls and Slack
Merge small components at a time to reduce merge conflicts.
